## 1. Business Context {.smaller}

|  |  |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Business Problem** | **ML Problem** |
| Acquire new clients through a direct-mail campaign | Develop a marketing response model and target high-response prospects |
| Approve or reject loan applications based on risk | Develop a credit scorecard model and approve low-risk applications |
| Explain why a loan application was rejected | List the differences between an approved application and a rejected application that are otherwise very similar (i.e., a counterfactual) |
| Set aside an allowance for bad loans | Develop a transition matrix model and calibrate loan default probabilities to observed frequencies |
| Block fraudulent transactions | Develop a cost-sensitive model and block high-risk transactions |

## 2. Data Prep

1.  Borrower data from an Indian Bank and Credit Bureau. The instructor modified the data to include `campaign_id`, `control_group`, and `response_flag`. [@cibil-data].

2.  Loan Performance data from LendingClub. Includes both accepted and rejected loan applications. [@lendingclub-data]

3.  Single-Family Loan Performance data from Fannie Mae. [@fanniemae2024]

4.  Simulated data from the *Fraud Detection Handbook* . [@leborgne2022fraud]

![](Images/Scikit_learn_logo_small.svg.png)

-   AutoGluon is an open-source AutoML framework designed to automate model training and ensembling.
-   AutoGluon achieves strong performance by using ensembling techniques and a comprehensive library of preset hyperparameters for each base learner.
-   AutoGluon offers data preprocessing like automatic encoding of categorical variables and automatic removal of features with no variance.
-   Scikit-learn provides calibration methods (e.g., Platt scaling, isotonic regression) to improve the reliability of predicted probabilities.

    -   Reinforce understanding of weekly material and practical application of concepts.
2.  Kaggle Competition (30%)
    -   Develop a scorecard model for loan underwriting.
    -   Students will be asked why the model rejected a loan application.
    -   Grades will depend on model performance in an unlabeled test set and the quality of the explanation.

# Introduction to Retail Banking

![](Images/dalle-bank-building.png){fig-align="center"}

## What is a Retail Bank?

-   A retail bank serves individual consumers, households, and small businesses
-   Offers deposit and lending products: checking/savings accounts, certificates of deposit, credit cards, and mortgages
-   Large retail banks also offer brokerage and wealth management services

## Revenue Sources

-   Interest collected from loans (e.g., credit cards, auto loans, personal loans, mortgages)
-   Transaction fees, commissions, and service charges
-   Major contributor to profitability: spread between interest collected from loans and interest paid to depositors

## Expense Sources

-   Employee compensation
-   Interest paid to depositors
-   Provision for loan losses

## How could a Bank fail?

-   Insufficient liquidity (not enough cash to meet obligations)
-   Insufficient capital (not enough equity to absorb losses)
-   High levels of non-performing loans or significant credit losses
-   Sudden loss of depositor confidence leading to a bank run

## What is FDIC insurance?

-   Protects depositors by guaranteeing their funds up to a certain limit if a bank fails
-   Aims to maintain public confidence and prevent bank runs
-   Standard insurance amount in the US: \$250,000 per depositor, per insured bank

## How do Banks use machine learning?

-   Improve the effectiveness of marketing campaigns
-   Measure the credit risk of loan applicants
-   Estimate the lifetime credit losses of a loan portfolio
-   Detect fraudulent activities

# Introduction to Credit Bureaus

```

## US Credit Bureaus

-   The US has three major credit bureaus:
    -   Experian
    -   TransUnion
    -   Equifax
-   Credit bureaus serve three major functions:
    -   Collect and maintain consumer credit information
    -   Provide credit reports to lenders
    -   Generate credit scores

## Bureau Data Structure

-   **Consumer Information**:
    -   Borrower details: Name, address, SSN, birthdate
    -   Employment data (if reported)
    -   Credit scores from different scoring models
-   **Trade Lines (Accounts)**:
    -   Account details: Creditor, type, opened/closed dates
    -   Credit terms: Limit, payment amount, loan amount
    -   Current status: Balance, utilization, payment status
    -   Payment history: 24-84 months of payment records

## Credit Report Inquiries

-   **Hard Inquiries**:
    -   Result from credit applications
    -   Visible to all lenders
    -   Impact credit scores
-   **Soft Inquiries**:
    -   Account reviews, promotional screening
    -   Only visible to consumer
    -   No impact on credit scores

## Credit Scores

-   Two major scoring models:
    -   FICO
    -   VantageScore
-   Credit Score Ranges:
    -   Excellent: 800+
    -   Very Good: 740-799
    -   Good: 670-739
    -   Fair: 580-669
    -   Poor: Below 580

# Prescreen Campaigns to Acquire New Clients

![](/Images/dalle-credit-card-offer.png){fig-align="center"}

## Prescreen Process

```{dot}
digraph {
    rankdir=TD; // Top-down
    size="8,5"; // Set graph aspect ratio
    nodesep=1.0; // Increases horizontal spacing between nodes

    // Define global style for nodes and edges
    node [shape=rectangle, style=rounded];

    // Define nodes
    B [label="Bank B"];
    C [label="Credit Bureau"];
    M [label="Marketing Company"];
    P [label="Prospect"];

    // Define edges
    B -> C [label="Sends Selection Criteria"];
    C -> M [label="Generates Prospects List"];
    M -> P [label="Mails Offers"];
}
```

## Business Problem {.smaller}

-   The marketing team wants to acquire new credit card customers through a direct mail campaign
-   The campaign features a **zero-interest rate balance transfer promotion** for 12 months
-   Campaign costs include: mail costs, credit bureau fees, and expected credit losses
-   The marketing budget is limited, so the marketing team asks you to identify high-response prospects
-   Compliance with regulatory requirements (FCRA, ECOA) is necessary

## Business Solution {.smaller}

-   Develop selection criteria for credit bureau prescreening
    -   Credit Score \>= 700
    -   No delinquent loan payments in the last 60 months
    -   At least one active credit card with 60 months of on-time payments
    -   Must live within a list of 20 metropolitan statistical areas (MSA)
-   In addition to the selection criteria, your model would identify high-response prospects

## Machine Learning Problem {.smaller}

-   Train a classification model to identify prospects most likely to accept the offer
-   Requires historical campaign data, response flags, and relevant bureau attributes
-   Develop a model that maximizes AUC and estimate a probability threshold that maximizes the F1 score, precision, or recall
-   Score prospects, select high-scoring individuals for the campaign
-   Measure the effectiveness of the campaign using a control group

## Features to Consider {.smaller}

-   Credit Utilization: Higher utilization → Higher response rates
-   Revolving Balances: Higher balances → Higher response rates
-   Balance Transfer History: Previous transfers → Higher response rates
-   Recent Inquiries: More inquiries → Higher response rates

## Prescreening Compliance Framework {.smaller}

-   Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
    -   Do not prescreen consumers who are on the opt-out list
    -   Applicants who meet the prescreening criteria should be approved for credit
    -   If the application is declined, provide clear reasons
-   Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)
    -   Prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age
    -   Apply consistent underwriting standards to all applicants
    -   Maintain documentation to demonstrate non-discriminatory practices and facilitate regulatory reviews
